C++ Library for Facial Performance Capture with Kinect 

## Setup

### Dependency

1. Install Eigen (>=3.3)
1. Install VTK (>=8.1.0)
1. Install OpenCV (2.4.X)
1. Install OpenNI, OpenNI2
1. Clone and install libfreenect's latest master branch(https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect) and OpenNI2-FreenectDriver.
    Remember to copy the driver into OpenNI2's repository folder(Check (https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect/tree/master/OpenNI2-FreenectDriver))
1. Clone and install PCL's latest master branch (https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl) (> 1.8.1).
    Their lastest binary release(1.8.1) has bugs with kinect v1. Don't use it.
1. Install ceres-solver

#### Or use docker image for this project

You don't have to install all of them. I made an Docker image for developing and testing this project. Please checkout `docker/HOW_TO_USE_DOCKER.md`.

### Additional Setup for Temporary Implementation

1. put your LIB.a into lib/libface.a
1. put your MODELLOADINGCODE.cpp into src/io/modelio.cpp
1. put your MODELS into models/
1. put your LIBHEADERS into include/face/


## Build

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
```

This project is still not FOSS. Some of the project files are missing in this repository. We are working on making it free.
